The memebers of the group can be found in the contributor section of the main page

The detailed project description can be found in [here](https://teaching.csse.uwa.edu.au/units/CITS3002/project/)

The main idea for this project is to code a Test Manager and Question Bank in their respective languages and create a socket server between the two that allows for requests that a client makes on their browser to be fulfilled. 

## How to run 
Before running the Test Manager please make sure your in the Test-Manager directory. 
```
    make
```

```
    ./server [port]
```

Qb to come later...


## View output 
Simply go to your browser and go to localhost:[port] and you will see the magic happen!!
