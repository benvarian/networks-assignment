# send vs write, read vs recv, flush.
# send retruns how many bytse were sent through, this is our responsibility to handle. otherwise not all will go throguh.
# will want either a header containing how many bytes to send through, or a footer saying 'done'
# if recv returns 0, the connecting is closed on the otherside, or is in the process of closing.
# make sure to always end in sock.close()
# socket.setblocking(False) -- no blocking. research more.
# send seems better than sendall.
