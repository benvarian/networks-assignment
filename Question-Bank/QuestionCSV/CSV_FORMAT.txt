The CSV's are formatted with the following variables:
QID,T,Q,A
qid is the id of the question. -- even means it is python, and odd means it is c. QB's will use only one question databases 
                                    (not out of technical limitation, rather out of our interpretation of the project requirements)
T is the 'type' of question -- M means multi choice, P means Programming.
Q is the question -- in multi choice questions this will include each of the choices.
A is the answer -- in programming questions it will contain a script that writes the correct answer.
    in multi choice questions it will contain either A, B, C, or D which is what the web side returns on a submission attempt

In order to avoid unwanted bugs and generally make life easier,
    '\y' maps to '\n'
    '\c' maps tp ',' as commas are, of course, a part of csv format.
    '\t' maps to '{tabspace}' (python doesn't otherwise recognise \t as an escaped sequence.)
